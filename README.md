Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Overview  
This project aims to segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** using **K-Means Clustering**. The goal is to help businesses understand different customer groups, which can be useful for **targeted marketing, personalized promotions, and customer behavior analysis**.  

The dataset used is Mall Customer Segmentation Data, which contains customer demographics and spending patterns. The clustering algorithm groups customers into segments based on similarities in their spending behavior.
